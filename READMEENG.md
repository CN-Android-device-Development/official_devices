CDT (CN Android Device Development) Developer Terms 

CN Android device Development is a non-profit organization initiated by YomiSasaki. This organization will review and provide the device applied by the developer. The developer must comply with the following terms 

1: 3 years support. 

2: The device will be responsible for any scenarios by the developer. If the device gets bricked, stolen, broken, the developer needs to fix it/get it back or return the money to the community. 

3: The developer's work will be open-sourced and freely available to the community. 

4: The community will not provide additional resources such as servers. 

5: After 3 years, he can sell the device if he wants. 

6: If the community is not satisfied with the developer's work, he needs to return the device unconditionally. 

7: The management team does not manage developers, but audits development quality. 

8: We will collect valid identification (mobile phone number + name). It will only be shared with the event organizer (community admin) and not with anyone else for privacy reasons. 

9: Just saying acceptance of the terms will not be considered - a developer who agrees to all terms must write a self-declaration of acceptance of all terms, sign it and send it to the community manager. 

When the developer finally meets all requirements, we will announce through the channel that the developer has signed the contract.
